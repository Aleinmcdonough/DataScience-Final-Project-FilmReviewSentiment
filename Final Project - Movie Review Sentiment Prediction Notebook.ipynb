    "This project is designed to predict whether the sentiment of a film review is positive or negative based upon the words used in the review.  This project uses a dataset of film reviews from IMDB with two features, the text of the review and the sentiment of the review (0 is negative, 1 is positive).  The model checks which words show up in each review with a Count Vectorizer and uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to check if a given review's opinion of the film is positive or not."

We used a Multinomial Naive Bayes model as it was able to return give the greatest accuracy of all of the models used on this dataset.  We first considering using Decision Trees, and while it's average accuracy was 81%, we felt that there could be other models.  Next, we tries using Support Vector Machines and only models with the linear kerner were able to sucessfully finish; all other kernels either failed to complete after 12 hours, returned errors, or caused the browser and/or operating system to crash.  We got an accuracy of 83% for SVM with the linear kernel.  We then tries using a few variants of Naive Bayes including Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli; only Gaussian and Multinomial completed without errors.  We settled on using Multinomial Naive Bayes as it outperformed all of the other algorithms in terms of average accuracy.  We could not try more models due to time constraints."

    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our Multinomial Naive Bayes model, we were able to get 84% Accuracy (With a ~98.6% confidence interval between 81% and 87% Accuracy) for determining whether our review's sentiment was poisitve or negative.  While this model returning 84% accuracy is good, I think there are many ways we could improve this model.  First, we could have the Count Vectorizer include not just individual words, but combinations of multiple words as features; Sometimes the context of what is meant is lost when you just take certain groups of words on their own rather than together.  However, we may have to significantly reduce the size of the data we use for our training and test datasets as not to encounter a memory error. Also, we could use a different method for our classification model that might yield a greater accuracy (I.E. a neural network based model), but it may requre more time and memory resources as not to run into any errors or crashes."
